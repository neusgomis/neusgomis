## :handshake:About Me

From the glitz of 5-star hospitality to the intricacies of Human Resources, my journey's been quite the ride. But it was coding, stumbled upon just a year and a half ago, that truly stole my heart :heart: There's something magical about turning ideas into reality through code! Fueled by curiosity and determination, I dove into programming, learning online and recently graduating from an intense web development bootcamp. Despite the challenges, the sense of achievement was priceless. Now, armed with new skills and overflowing excitement, I'm eager to dive into software development.

Let's learn, grow, and innovate together! ðŸ’»âœ¨
